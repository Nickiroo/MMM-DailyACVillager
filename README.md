# MMM-DailyACVillager

Inspired by NolanKingdon, creator of the DailyPokemon module for the magic mirror

## Coming updates:
- Clean up the css and make it just in general better looking
- Add a font option in the config to include animal crossing fonts
- add background option
- add different theme options that match vs code themes

### What am I looking at here?
This is a module for the MagicMirrorÂ², an open source project for making smart mirrors that uses a modular system for displaying information on a screen that sits under a 1 way mirror. All documentation for that can be found here: https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror


MMM-DailyACVillager provides a unique Animal Crossing villager each day, or some other time interval, as well as information about that villager including personality, birthday, species, and a small sprite of the villager's face.

Built Using the RESTful ACNHAPI, so all information is going to be as up to date as possible. The api can be found here: http://acnhapi.com/ and if you wish to donate to the creator of the api that makes most ACNH projects possible you can do so here: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/acnhapi
